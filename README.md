# Draggable-Panel
Purely handcrafted project on Java by incorporating drag and drop on JPanel

The way I track the mouse movement or delta position each time the drag mouse method is invoked might not be the most efficient, as I was figuring this approach all by myself and didn't try to explore any other available methods. There might be properties in MouseEvent e argument passed that tells the mouse movement relative to the previous mouse position that I didn't realize.
